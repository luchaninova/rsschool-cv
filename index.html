        <h2>Summary</h2>
        I enjoy coding. I`m interested in Web development and intend to move
        career pas in the IT field. I am currently trying to get some technical
        background. I’ve got a Master of Marketing degree. Also, I had the
        opportunity to work with money in a financial institution and some
        experience in trading. I can provide high-quality and polite customer
        service. I have worked as a freelance internet marketer on several
        projects for the past 5+ years. My main field was copywriting, video
        editing, and maintaining youtube channels. I never stopped learning
        English. My greatest ambition is to make a difference. My hobby is
        woodburning and I have a small shop on Etsy with hand-made accessories.
        I am open to new projects.
